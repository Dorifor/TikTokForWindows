This is a part of my research on TikTok API. This help to make file containing argument, with value and type of value. In the near future, I'll try to make it be able to find if the value change, depending on various URL given by users.

It will be able to read URL from : 
*Console.ReadLine
*File passed by parameter
*File passed via Console.ReadLine
